- 👋 Hi, I’m Julia Scott
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about technology as I don't come from a tech background and I am the founder of a legal tech company (although I am a lawyer) and meeting people interested in tech!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about all things tech related.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building my software to help lawyers automate manual and low value tasks so they can spend time on what matters.
- 📫 How to reach me - by email: scottjulia18@gmail.com or on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-scott-53998b7b/
